// --- Sync Overlap Lock ---

// fileLock is an advisory exclusive lock backed by flock(2). It is the
// single overlap-prevention mechanism for both scheduling modes: the
// built-in ticker (in-process, startup pass vs interval pass) and the
// external `sync` subcommand (cross-process, scheduled run vs manual
// docker exec). flock associates the lock with the open file description,
// so two independent os.OpenFile calls contend even within one process.
type fileLock struct {

// another holder currently owns the lock (a pass is already in flight). On
// ok the caller must release the lock with unlock.
